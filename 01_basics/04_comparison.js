// console.log("2">1);
// console.log("02">1);

// console.log(null > 0);
// console.log(null == 0);// equality sign works differently than comparison signs
// console.log(null >= 0);// this is true becoz comparisons convert null to a num i.e null is treated as 0

console.log(undefined == 0);

// === strict check, it checks values as well as data type 


//we need to avoid all the above comparisons, it creates confusion
