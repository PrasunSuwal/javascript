// arrays are resizeable i.e add can be added into the array

//shallow and deep copy

//shhalow copy means properties share same reference 
//in array it creates shallow copy


const myArr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const myArr2 = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4)//this another method of declaring array

console.log(myArr[0]);

//Array methods
